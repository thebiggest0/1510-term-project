## Game Controls and Key Symbols

Welcome to the game! This section provides you with the essential controls and key symbols you will encounter throughout your adventure. Master these to navigate effectively and conquer challenges that lie ahead.

## Character Controls

    Movement: Use the W, A, S, D keys to move your character in the desired direction.
    Check Stats: Press the Q key to view your current stats, including HP, STR, INT, experience and levels.

## Key Symbols

    X: This symbol represents your character. It's your avatar in this epic journey.
    P (Palpatine): Encounter with the final boss. Prepare for a challenging battle.
    V (Darth Vader): This symbol denotes the second boss. A formidable opponent requiring strategy and strength.
    O: Represents mini-bosses like Count Dooku and General Grievous. Each mini-boss offers unique challenges.
    J (Force Ghost): These are fallen jedi masters that provide unlimited healing and stat bonus. Answer their questions correctly to gain their aid.
    #: These are walls within the game. They define boundaries and obstacles in your path.

## Game Secrets

    1. Force Ghosts do not disappear, players can interact with them multiple times to gain boots and healing
    2. Stat increase from the Froce Ghost is random, so constantly check your Stats with 'q' and use the higher value
    3. The highest obtainable level is 5, the more states you have at the time of level up the higher the bonus
    4. Physical attack is corolated to your strength while force attack is corrolated with your intelegence
    5. At anytime in the game, if your HP reaches 0 you will lose and your character will be deleted

## Game Save

Our game supports multiple player accounts. Try out all 3 difficulties while keeping each file saved. Make sure to 
choose a different name so you don't override the previously saved data.

Your game will auto save after a successful character movement, level up, battle and interaction. Exit the game and log
back in by entering the same character name.
